#This code will create a secure application and load the Greengrass application into memory. 
#The Greengrass application will then be started and will run until it finishes. Once the Greengrass application finishes, it will be destroyed and the Parsec library will be shut down.

#This is just a basic example of how to use ARM Parsec to secure AWS Greengrass applications. For more information, please see the ARM Parsec and AWS Greengrass documentation.
