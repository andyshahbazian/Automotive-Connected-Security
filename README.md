# TPM-HSM
Edge TPM and Cloud HSM for Automotive workloads 

TEE is available by default on some ARM Cortex processors. The ARM TrustZone technology provides the foundation for TEEs on ARM Cortex processors. TrustZone is a security extension that allows the processor to be divided into two separate security domains: the secure world and the non-secure world. The secure world is isolated from the non-secure world, and it can only be accessed by trusted software.

Some ARM Cortex processors that support TEE by default include:

Cortex-A72
Cortex-A53
Cortex-A35
Cortex-M33
Cortex-M23


A TEE, or trusted execution environment, is a secure area of memory on a computing device where sensitive data and code can be executed. The TEE is isolated from the rest of the system, so it cannot be accessed by unauthorized users or processes. This makes the TEE ideal for applications that require high levels of security, such as financial transactions, medical records, and government data.

The TEE is implemented in hardware and software. The hardware provides the physical isolation of the TEE, while the software provides the security mechanisms that protect the TEE from unauthorized access.

There are two main types of TEEs:

Hardware-based TEEs are implemented in the processor's firmware. This makes them very secure, but it also makes them more difficult to implement and use.
Software-based TEEs are implemented in software running on the operating system. This makes them easier to implement and use, but they are not as secure as hardware-based TEEs.
TEEs are becoming increasingly important as more and more applications require high levels of security. As the demand for security grows, TEEs are likely to become more widespread.

Here are some of the benefits of using a TEE:

Security: The TEE is isolated from the rest of the system, so it cannot be accessed by unauthorized users or processes. This makes the TEE ideal for applications that require high levels of security.
Performance: The TEE can be used to run sensitive computations in a secure environment, without impacting the performance of the rest of the system.
Convenience: The TEE can be used to protect sensitive data and code, without requiring the user to take any special steps.
Here are some of the challenges of using a TEE:

Complexity: The TEE is a complex technology, and it can be difficult to implement and use.
Cost: The TEE can add to the cost of a computing device.
Compatibility: The TEE may not be compatible with all applications.
TEEs are a promising technology that can help to improve the security of computing devices. However, there are some challenges that need to be addressed before TEEs can become more widespread.

## Securing Greengrass with Parsec
ARM Parsec is a software framework that provides a secure execution environment for applications on ARM-based devices. It uses the ARM TrustZone technology to create a secure partition in the device's memory where applications can run in a trusted environment.
AWS Greengrass is a cloud-based platform that allows you to run code and services on edge devices. It provides a secure way to connect your devices to the cloud and to share data and insights.
an idea would be in the sample code we will create a secure application and load the Greengrass application into memory. The Greengrass application will then be started and will run until it finishes. Once the Greengrass application finishes, it will be destroyed and the Parsec library will be shut down.

This is just a basic example of how to use ARM Parsec to secure AWS Greengrass applications. For more information, please see the ARM Parsec and AWS Greengrass documentation.
