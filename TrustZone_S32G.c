//This code will create a secure application and load it into memory.
//The secure application will then be started and will run until it finishes. Once the secure application finishes, 
//it will be destroyed and the TrustZone and Parsec libraries will be shut down.

//This is just a basic example of how to use ARM Cortex 53's TrustZone in conjunction with ARM Parsec
//to secure applications. For more information, please see the ARM TrustZone and ARM Parsec documentation.
